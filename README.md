## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
#### Netflix: 
- Wide selection of movies and tv shows that are tailored based on the ones you have watched.
- Video Player is simple and very intuitive, allowing easy changes to brightness and volume.

#### Animir u
- Uses multiple sources to scrape videos of anime shows.
- Has support for numerous anime trackers to keep track of the shows you watched.
- Allows for offline video playback.

#### TickTick
- Has integrated calenders that allow you to plan according to your events
- Uses your natural language to filter and add tags accordingly without extra steps
- Built in productivity features like a pomodoro timer or eisenhower matrix

### App Brainstorming:
I have an idea for an app that tracks all of your tv shows, movies, and animes from different sources. Some people use MAL or AniLis to track anime but it is annoying to constantly go to a website on your computer to fill out the information. Having all the data and information right on your phone would be beneficial to some people.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Finding where the run simulation button is located.
- Accessing the code assistant.
- Revert edits

## Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Introducing additional amusing features to the app
- Have different levels that are puzzles
- Include animations to make the experience more fun
